/**
 * This is the implementation of Hashed Array Tree (HAT) data structure that is the same as Dynamic
 * Array (ArrayList in Java) in terms of time complexity, however, it wastes O(SQRT(N)) extra space
 * when increasing capacity.
 *
 * Although name implies hashing, HAT does not use any hash.
 *
 * Initially, we start with base array  that stores only references to leaf arrays whose size is
 * the same as base array. Every time current leaf array is full we create new leaf array and start
 * to insert data into newly created leaf array.
 *
 * When increasing capacity, we double size of base array and leaf create leaf arrays with doubles
 * size and copy entries from previous HAT. In this way, only quarter of newly created HAT is full
 * and other leaf arrays will be null.
